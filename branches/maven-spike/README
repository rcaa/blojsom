blojsom contains a number of third-party software components.

blojsom uses Maven for its build management. Some dependencies are stored on a
dedicated maven repository at www.anothercaffeinatedday.com.

The repository uses HTTPS. This will cause problems in your IDE and makes users
the repository "dedicated users"; for only a dedicated user would bother with
managing the certificates in the JDK keystore.

The following is the recommended way preparing the maven build:

1. The HTTPS certificate issuer, cacert.org, should (and must) be added to your 
   JDK cacerts trust database.

   Download the cacert certificates from cacert.org:

   % curl -k -o "cacert-root.crt" "https://www.cacert.org/certs/root.crt"
   % curl -k -o "cacert-class3.crt" "https://www.cacert.org/certs/class3.crt"

   VALIDATE EACH CERTIFICATE!

   MD5 and SHA1 hashes are available here:
   https://www.cacert.org/index.php?id=3

   `keytool' provides a view mode:

   % keytool -printcert -file /path/to/crtfile | grep -A5 "Valid from"

   Now, add the certificates to the cacerts trust database:

   % keytool -import -alias cacert.org-root \
   > -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts \
   > -file /path/to/cacert-root.crt

   % keytool -import -alias cacert.org-class3 \
   > -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts \
   > -file /path/to/cacert-class3.crt

2. Add the HTTPS server public key to your personal keystore:

   % keytool -import -alias www.anothercaffeinatedday.com 
   > -file www.anothercaffeinatedday.com-expires-2010-03-20.cer

   NB: You may be required to `sudo' to update the keystore. The command on
       Snow Leopard (Mac OS X 10.6.x) differs slightly where there is no "JRE":

       % keytool -import -alias cacert.org-root \
       > -keystore /Library/Java/Home/lib/security/cacerts \
       > -file /path/to/cacert-root.crt

       /Library/Java/Home is a symlink to the current, OS default, JDK.

       Snow Leopard ships with Java 1.6.0.

   The default keystore password is "changeit".

   The certificate is issued by cacert.org and is routinely expired and updated.
   You will have to perform this task periodically.
